# nir_rv
Radial velocities for low-resolution NIR spectra using telluric features to provide absolute wavelength calibration. Requires a standard star (M dwarf spectra included), and both the telluric and non-telluric-corrected spectra. Orders do not need to be combined. 

See check_standards for an example of usage. 

Run check_standards to test code.
